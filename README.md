# Project Two 
By Brianna De La Torre

## Overview 
In terms of what community meant to me, I find community within my friends. And a poem by Orion Carlotto, tittled did i tell you how i found god in the arms of my friends perfectly represents how i feel towards my friends and the impact they have on me. It was not until I moved to San Francisco and met the people I have now in my life now that I finally felt apart of something, making them my community. The poem goes on to explain how she finds pieces of things that remind her of hear friends in the little things of her day to day activities or routines. This completely expresses and explains how I feel about my friends and those who surround me and how they have helped shape me into the person I am today. 

## Technical Overview
Because of the sweetness and simplicity of the poem I wanted to make something that was not too over complicated and keep it short and sweet.
